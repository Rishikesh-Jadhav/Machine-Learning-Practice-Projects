# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository serves as a record of my ML projects as a part of a ML course completed in December 2023. It includes project notebooks for both structutred data and unstructured data projects. Each type of project is organized within its respective folder, complete with accompanying documentation and any necessary resources. Additionally there are a few practice notebooks for concept revision for data science and ML tools(pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit learn) in the Practice Notebooks folder.

## ðŸ“„ Projects List

### [Structuted data project](https://github.com/Rishikesh-Jadhav/Machine-Learning-Practice-Projects/tree/main/Structured%20Data%20Projects): End-to-end structured data project 

- **Bluebook bulldozer price regression**:

<!--  1. __Rendering First Mesh:__ Acquired a basic understanding of mesh rendering using PyTorch3D.

  2. __Practicing with Cameras:__ Created 360-degree gifs and set camera viewpoints for rendering.

  3. __Re-creating the Dolly Zoom:__ Successfully implemented the Dolly Zoom effect in PyTorch3D.
